**Here are my learnings:** </br>
I am a beginner and wanted to learn through a hands-on project. Please feel free to provide your feedback!

Issue #1 - How to get the response value from a markup keyboard? </br>
Initially, I experimented with ReplyKeyboardMarkup but I could not retrieve the value. With further research, I learnt that using InlineKeyboard was a better choices as it offers a CallbackQuery method which allowed retrieval of response value. 

Issue #2 - How to establish a process flow? For example, the first markup keyboard will prompt for the selection of action. If action == Spin the Bottle, the second markup keyboard will prompt for the selection of Truth or Dare. The keyboards were appearing at the same time. </br> 
I made use of ConversationHandler to handle the different states of a conversation: https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/telegram.ext.conversationhandler.html
